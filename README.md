# A framework combining PHP, Javascript and Ajax

This little framework is made from a course I give on PHP. It became a little bigger by adding some examples of usage and through some projects. Anyhow, it's time to create a repo of this project and keep it on.

## Installing

Not complicated but it needs to install a database and configure the config file.

## Documentation

It's in the project once it's installed. By going in the administration.
