# A framework combining PHP, Javascript and Ajax

This little framework is made from a course I give on PHP. It became a little bigger by adding some examples of usage and through some projects. Anyhow, it's time to create a repo of this project and keep it on.

## Installing

Not complicated but it needs to install a database and configure the config.ini file.

## Documentation

All documentation are in the framework. Set where we need it. Classes and methods are PHP doc commented so it can be seen in a contextual way in code editor such as Netbeans. The administration area has a documentation section explaining how code process works.
